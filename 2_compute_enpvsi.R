# Name of script:	2_compute_enpvsi.R [to run type: source('2_compute_enpvsi.R')]
# Purpose: 	To calculate the expected net present value of sample information (ENPVSI) calculation 
#			for the PU model (in parent script '1_master.R') for different trial sizes.
# Author(s):	Peter Hall, Klemens Wallner
# Note(s):	1) The script '1_master.R' needs to before running this script, which is
#			based on those results and objects created.
#			2) The steps from the general Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for calculation of 
#			population ENPVSI are denoted as A1. to A3., and refer to the (adjusted) algorithm in
#			the appendix of the article by Hall et al. (2011):
#			Hall, P. S., Edlin, R., Kharroubi, S., Gregory, W., & McCabe, C. (2012). Expected net 
#			present value of sample information: from burden to investment. 
#			Medical Decision Making, 32(3), E11â€“21. doi:10.1177/0272989X12443010.
#			3) Ades et al. (2004) refers to:
#			Ades, A. E., Lu, G., & Claxton, K. (2004). Expected value of sample information 
#			calculations in medical decision modeling. Medical Decision Making, 24(2), 
#			207â€“27. doi:10.1177/0272989X04263162.
#			4) Currently the outputs are stored in the working directory.
